# InstaUnfollower

Many people are obsessed with Social Media who follows and who does not follow back.For that I created a Instagram Unfollowers bot which uses Selenium for comparing the count of usernames of Followers and Following which are stored in Python list data structure.After the comparison a .csv file is generated which shows the accounts who does not follow us back.

secret- Importing the secret file which contains the username and password in string format as shown below.Save the extension as .py file and in the same directory as original Python file.

username = "abc"
pwd = "xyz"
